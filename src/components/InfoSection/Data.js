    "Hello, my name is Dian and I built this website with the purpose to introduce myself. I am a 20-year-old Computer Science student and soon to be a Junior Developer. I did an internship a couple of months ago and I learned more than my whole tie in university. My main goal for my 20ties is to grow rapidly both professionally and personally so I can achieve my plans. That is why I decided to force my way into the industry, so I can take a solid step up into my career. Many recruiters might say that it is probably too soon, and they are probably right. I have applied for more than 300 companies in the last two months, but I constantly improved my skills and now I am in the final stages in a couple of companies.  My best and favourite skill above all is commitment, which is hard to maintain, but a strong ally. I have other qualities and interest despite career obsession, but I feel they are most suited for a conversation. Joining your company will give me the chance to prove myself and you will benefit from it. Believe in my passion and you will believe in my potential.",

    "As for my education experience, I come from one of the most prestigious high schools in my country. It was a Mathematics high school, so we had intense training in advanced mathematics and programming. There I started with C++ when I was 14, then with C# at 15 and decided to start Java at 16 on my own. Now I am a Computer Science student at the University of Surrey.  I had 69.13% (2:1) during the first year, and now I am maintaining 70%+ (first) but focusing on different from the course technologies. As for the work, I worked during the summers and part-time during the school years as a labourer and assistant production manager. I mainly did physical work and helped with a lot of calculations and planning as I was good at maths. My Full-Stack Developer Intern time had the greatest impact on me, both personally and professionally. I worked on a lot of technologies and full life cycle of development, but the main thing is that I started loving the industry and the community.",

    "As a mostly self-thought developer, I am constantly experimenting with new ways of learning and I am looking for the most efficient one.  For now, the best way that I learn is by developing projects. I usually spend I lot of time searching for the right materials and deciding with technologies to choose. After I read the basics I get right into the deep waters with a Project. For the back-end technologies, I wanted to try all of them out so I can have experience with everything and to build an opinion for my likes and dislikes. I have done Java (Spring), C# (ASP.NET), Python (Django), NodeJS (Express), Ruby (Rails) and C++. As for the front-end, I tried Angular then I tried React and I fell in love. I have been doing React for the front-end of everything, but I have more yet to explore. For more detailed and boring information about my projects, you can download my cool CV from the pizza icon in my cool footer.",
